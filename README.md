My name is Elie Ndorimana, and I am a Master’s student at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) Rwanda, specializing in Data Science. I am passionate about leveraging mathematics, statistics, and computational tools to extract insights from data and address real-world problems.

My academic and research interests include machine learning, data-driven decision-making, and data visualization. I also enjoy working on collaborative projects that allow me to apply advanced analytics to solve practical challenges.

Looking ahead, my goal is to contribute to innovative, impactful solutions that harness the power of data for sustainable development and societal transformation.
